Implement strStr().
Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
Clarification:
What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

For a marginally faster approach, you could check characters one at a time, 
however this code is much cleaner and handles corner cases such as empty string 
quite elegantly (Python 3 string splicing s[0:0] = "").

class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        idx = 0
        while idx <= len(haystack)-len(needle):
            if haystack[idx:idx+len(needle)] == needle:
                return idx
            idx += 1
        return -1
