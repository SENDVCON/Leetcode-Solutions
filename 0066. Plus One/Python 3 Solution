'''
Intuition: Consider how addition is done by hand, we sum columns
right to left and carry-over amounts greater than 10.

class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        carry = 1

        for i in range(1,len(digits)+1):
            col_sum = digits[-i] + carry
            if col_sum < 10:
                carry = 0
                digits[-i] = col_sum
                break
            else:
                digits[-i] = col_sum % 10
                #carry = 1
                
        '''
        If carry is still > 0, that means the last column had an 
        amount carried over and we need to extend our digit by one
        '''
        if carry > 0:
            return [carry] + digits

        return digits
